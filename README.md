# code2040-TechAssessment
Technical Assessment for the Code2040 Fellows program application


Taking this challenge has helped me develop my programming and independent research skills. I did not have prior knowledge of APIs, and this challenge helped me learn about them and program in that environment. I hope I can follow up my completion of this challenge by excelling in my phone interview(s) and earning an engineering/software internship through the Code2040 Fellows Program.
